#' Read a ZIP file with patterns and other data as it comes from the SafeGraph Shop
#'
#' This will open up a ZIP file from the SafeGraph shop and will read all of the data in, performing processing of the patterns files using \code{read_patterns}.
#'
#' The result will be a named list with each of the components of the data.
#'
#' @param filename The filename of the \code{.zip} file from the shop.
#' @param dir The directory the file is in.
#' @param keeplist Character vector of the files in the ZIP to read in. Use \code{'patterns'} to refer to the patterns files.
#' @param exdir Name of the directory to unzip to.
#' @param cleanup Set to \code{TRUE} to delete all the unzipped files after being read in.
#' @param start_date An argument to be passed to \code{read_patterns} giving the first date present in the file, as a date object. When using \code{read_shop} this should usually be included, since the patterns file names in the shop files are not in a format \code{read_patterns} can pick up on automatically.
#' @param by,fun,na.rm,filter,expand_int,expand_cat,expand_name,multi,naics_link,select,gen_fips,silent,... Other arguments to be passed to \code{read_patterns}, specified as in \code{help(read_patterns)}. NOte that \code{gen_fips} is \code{FALSE} here by default, rather than \code{TRUE} as elsewhere, as files from the shop often do not contain the \code{poi_cbg} variable necessary to use it. Check which state indicator variables you have access to, perhaps \code{region}.
